Cover illustration for the article of Li, Karasnykov et al (Ramesh Pillai team at the Faculty of science of the University of Geneva) entitled "The XRN1-regulated RNA helicase activity of YTHDC2 ensures mouse fertility independently of m6A recognition" online March 18, 2022 in Molecular Cell. The "chameleon" cover has been chosen to enlight the article in the Molecular Cell issue of May, 5.

Legend: "as a chameleon changing its color, the "reader" of m6A RNA modification YTHDC2, dispenses of its recognition function and identify its RNA target through U-rich motif". The chameleon represents YTHDC2 and its patners. A chameleon blend into its sourrounding. YTHDC2 has first been identified as a "reader" of methylation marks m6A on the RNA. In this article, YTHDC2 is presented as an RNA helicase essential for fertility. The branch represent the RNA with U-rich motif under the tail of the chameleon, or "DRACH" motifs on the other branches. The chameleon goes from 3' to 5 (right to left) and come across a passiflora flower, representing the ribosome progressing on the RNA. The passion fruits represent the cells between meiosis and mitosis. 
Alternative cover image submitted to the journak: "The children". While a group of 4 children play ball, the 5th is occupied playing with tadpoles (the transcriptome) in two puddles (cells in meiosis and mitosis). The child is carrying on her back a schoolbag with her cuddly toy, symbolizing its partners, MEIOC and XRN1.
